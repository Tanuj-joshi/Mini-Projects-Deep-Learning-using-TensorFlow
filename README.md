# Deep-Learning-using-TensorFlow
Here, we have carried out some mini-Projects using TensorFlow:

  
   ##### 1) BBC News Archieve
         
      Tokenize the dataset i.e.,(BBC text archive), remove common stopwords. Design a NN that can be trained on 
      this dataset to accurately determine what words determine what category

   ##### 2) Horse vs Human Classifier

      Apply Transfer Learning to increase training accuracy for Horses v Humans classifier model. Use callback to avoid crazy overfitting,
      once validation set accuracy reaches desired value

   ##### 3) LSTM vs Convolutions

      Run 2 Models using a sarcasm dataset: 1 with a Bidirectional LSTM as its layer and another with 1D 
      Convolutional layer. Plot the accuracy and loss of the two models and compare it.

   ##### 4) Sentiment Analysis

      Train on a large dataset, as well as use transfer learning of an existing set of embeddings to explore 
      overfitting in NLP
